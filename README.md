 This one I'm really proud of! For a special topic Gender in Science course, the final project could be a 15-page essay or a creative project, so of course I designed and made a game which was equivalent in work to far more than 15 pages. This project started the development of me abstracting low-level details of getting user interaction in Java for my own purposes, as well as a lot of file reading shenanigans. For a one-woman project, I'm awfully proud of what I got working here, and oughta revisit it at some point to finish it.
